You've successfully created an AMPHTML ad that can be served on AMP and non-AMP pages! 

In this tutorial, you learned to:

* Create a valid AMPHTML ad according to the [AMPHTML ad spec](/docs/ads/a4a_spec.html)
* Track ad views by using the [`amp-pixel`](/docs/reference/components/amp-pixel.html) component
* Verify the AMPHTML ad syntax by using the [AMP validator](https://validator.ampproject.org/#htmlFormat=AMP4ADS)

## Next steps

You just learned how to create a basic image ad, but there are many more formats that you can use for AMPHTML ads. Visit [AMP By Example](https://ampbyexample.com/amp-ads/#amp-ads/advanced_ads), which provides advanced AMPHTML ad templates, like lightbox ads, carousel ads, video ads, slide ads, and more.
