		<h2><b>Monetization support for AMP stories</b></h2><p>AMP stories now supports ‘<a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/amp-story-ads.md#publisher-placed-ads">Publisher placed ads</a>’, the ability for a publisher to serve ads for which they can control delivery sales and delivery. Ad Server support in DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) is planned for the end of June. We urge other ad networks that are interested in adding monetization support to AMP stories to <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new">reach out to us</a>.</p><p><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-2065 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/6.jpg?w=660" alt="6" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/6.jpg 288w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/6.jpg?w=84 84w" sizes="(min-width: 288px) 288px, 100vw" width="288" height="512"></amp-img></p><p>See the details related to monetization related to AMP stories <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/amp-story-ads.md">here</a> or play with an example <a href="https://ampbyexample.com/stories/monetization/amp-story-auto-ads/">on AMPbyExample.com</a>.</p><h2><b>New user control tools in AMP </b></h2><p>We have launched the new <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-consent"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;amp-consent&gt;</span></a> component to help publishers implement user controls for customizable notice, choice, and consent flows. You can find all the usage and integration details related to the launch in <a href="https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/05/04/new-functionality-to-help-manage-user-choice-in-amp-pages/">this blog post</a><b>.</b></p><p>Relatedly, a new component, <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-geo"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;amp-geo&gt;</span></a>, makes it easy to vary small sections of web content for users based on an approximation of the users’ country-level location, similar to the level of an ISO Country Code. This can be used with <span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;amp-consent&gt;</span> to change the behavior of <span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;amp-consent&gt; </span>based on users’ approximate location. Check out an <a href="https://ampbyexample.com/user_consent/geolocation-based_consent_flow/">example</a> to see how the two components integrate.</p><h2><b>AMP Date Picker (Experimental)</b></h2><p>The <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-date-picker"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;amp-date-picker&gt;</span></a> component is a calendar-style interactive date picker for form input, and it’s officially available to use on sites as a <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/experimental#enable-an-experiment-for-a-particular-document">document-level experiment</a>. This means that developers can use the component as long as they also include this temporary tag: <span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;meta name=”amp-experiments-opt-in” content=”amp-date-picker”&gt;</span>. Check out the sample on  <a href="https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-date-picker/">AMP by Example</a> to see what it can do, and determine if it’s right for your site.</p><p><i>Note</i>: The reason for this intermediate stage of release (a document-level opt-in) is to collect feedback from developers and users and to identify any issues before we consider the component stable enough for a full production release. So expect some rough edges for now, <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new">let us know if you have any feedback</a>, and stay tuned for the full release later this quarter.</p><p><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-2051 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/2.png?w=660" alt="2" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/2.png 289w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/2.png?w=85 85w" sizes="(min-width: 289px) 289px, 100vw" width="289" height="512"></amp-img></p><h2><b>Introducing the image lightbox gallery</b></h2><p>Since AMP launched, developers have been asking for an easy way to link <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-image-lightbox"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;amp-carousel&gt;</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> with </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-image-lightbox"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;amp-image-lightbox&gt;</span></a> so users could experience an immersive view of content in carousels. While it’s been possible to combine numerous components (like <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-bind">&lt;amp-bind&gt;</a>) to make something like this work, it hasn’t been easy.</p><p>The <span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/14057">&lt;amp-lightbox-gallery&gt;</a> </span>component provides an immersive media experience that can stand on its own or can be integrated with the amp-carousel. The component can be applied to a standalone image or to a group of images so that when a user taps on these images, they enter an immersive view where they can seamlessly swipe from image to image. When <span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;amp-lightbox-gallery&gt; is applied to an &lt;amp-carousel&gt;</span>, all images in the carousel inherit the lightbox gallery behavior so that swipes between items in the immersive view are synced with those in the lightbox, to create a smooth, intuitive gallery experience.</p><p><amp-anim class=" size-full wp-image-2052 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/3.gif?w=660" alt="3" width="232" height="480" sizes="(min-width: 232px) 232px, 100vw"></amp-anim></p><h2></h2><h2><strong>New effects for amp-fx-collection</strong></h2><p>We’re just starting to build out &lt;<a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-fx-collection">amp-fx-collection</a>&gt;, a suite of easy-to-use visual effects that developers can use to make their sites more engaging. So far, we’ve released two effects: <a href="https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-fx-collection/">parallax</a>, which lets you easily configure page elements to move at different speeds relative to the scrolling speed of the document; and <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/14067">fade-in</a>, which applies a simple and configurable fade-in effect when the user scrolls content into view. Over the next few weeks, we’re planning to launch <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-fx-collection">fly-in</a> as well, which is currently available as an <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/experimental">experiment</a>. Check out the new features on <a href="https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-fx-collection/">AMP by Example</a> and let us know what you think.</p><amp-carousel width="600" height="480" type="slides" layout="responsive"><amp-img src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/5.gif?w=206" width="206" height="366" layout="responsive"></amp-img><amp-img src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/4.gif?w=270" width="270" height="480" layout="responsive"></amp-img></amp-carousel><h2></h2><h2><b>Ability to upload files</b></h2><p>File upload is an important capability for many sites.  For instance, some e-commerce sites incorporate custom design uploads into their purchase flows. To support this functionality we enabled file upload support in forms through <span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">&lt;input type=”file”&gt;</span>(essentially the same way developers would do this in a non-AMP page, with the additional requirement that the form uses a secure XHR submit). And now that AMP offers this basic support, we’re working on a more advanced API that will allow developers to better communicate to users the status of file uploads (bytes uploaded, % progress bars, etc).</p><h2><strong>The best of the rest</strong></h2><ul><li><a href="https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/05/08/a-first-look-at-using-web-packaging-to-improve-amp-urls/">Read more</a> about the progress on web packaging to help get rid of google.com/amp URLs when AMP documents are loaded from the Google AMP cache.</li>
