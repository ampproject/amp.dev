There are also a <a href="http://www.addthis.com/academy/the-advantages-of-google-amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few other advantages</a> to setting your website pages up for AMP, like additional traffic from platforms that link out to AMP websites like Google and Twitter. Learn more about creating your AMP page <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/getting_started/create" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>We’re excited to be joining the initiative to improve the content ecosystem and we believe users should still have the same functionality on AMP that they have on other platforms. That is why we’re one of the first third-party plugins to be available as an AMP component.</p><p>Ready to get started?
