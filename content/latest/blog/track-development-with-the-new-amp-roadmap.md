		<p>As the AMP project grows, we want to ensure that the community has a clear understanding of the features the team is working on and the status of each. Starting today, you can head over to the <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/roadmap">AMP roadmap</a> and see an updated view of feature development across the project. We hope this is easy to understand and offers better insight about what each feature means. As a developer, you can also continue to look at the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/releases">release logs</a> on a per release basis.</p><p>Each feature can be in the “Next Up”, “In Development” or “Shipped” categories.</p><p>If you are interested in more detail, you can click on the heading of the issue and navigate directly to the GitHub issue to learn about associated issues or pull requests.</p><p>Here are some features we specifically wanted to call your attention to:</p><h3>AMP stories</h3><ul><li>Monetization Support — Publishers can now use <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/amp-story-ads.md#ad-server-support-for-amp-story-ads">DoubleClick for publishers </a>to serve direct-sold, premium advertising to AMP stories. Next up, we are looking at supporting <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/16559">HTML5 story ads</a> over this quarter.</li>
<li>Learn about other stories related features in the blog post <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/new-in-amp-stories-monetization-revamped-bookends-and-metadata/">here</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>New UI features</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/amp-date-picker-is-launched/">amp-date-picker</a> — this is a full-featured date-picker for e-commerce use cases</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-next-page">amp-next-page</a> — this feature, which supports the “infinite scroll” of page-level content like new articles or blog posts, is now available as an <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/experimental">experiment on particular documents</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-date-countdown/amp-date-countdown.md">amp-date-countdown</a> — this component, generously contributed by community members, supports a dynamic countdown to a specified date &amp; time, primarily for e-commerce use cases like limited-time sales.</li>
</ul><h3>Upcoming Features</h3><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/16589">1-line PWA</a> — A large area of effort for the team is to figure out how to make it trivially easy for developers to create a PWA, given an AMP document. This includes smart caching and prefetching, as well as a way to ensure <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/14738">seamless page transitions</a> associated with single-page apps directly in AMP.</li>
<li>amp-consent — We are continuing to <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/15651">enhance</a> amp-consent functionality by providing publishers with the ability to fold their existing consent flows into AMP pages and manage consent status across AMP and non-AMP pages. We are also looking at supporting the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/15653">IAB framework </a>for user consent management.</li>
<li>AMPHTML ads — Over the next quarter, we will continue to work at improving the <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/16557">performance of AMPHTML ads</a>, especially when served to non-AMP pages. In addition, we will also work on supporting AMPHTML ads in <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/14365">mobile app environments</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/16737">ID Link Decoration</a> — We’re making page measurements easier by introducing ID Forwarding on AMP pages. The updates will help you see accurate metrics of your users and their journeys on your properties.</li>
</ul><p>As always, if you have questions or suggestions, please <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/new">share your feedback</a>.</p><p><em>Posted by Vamsee Jasti, Product Manager, AMP Project</em></p>	</div>
