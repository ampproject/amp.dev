		<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Hallo uit Amsterdam! We’re kicking off the second </span><a href="http://ampproject.org/amp-conf"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">AMP Conf</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> today in Europe, celebrating the global reach of the AMP community. This year we have </span><b>over 400 developers joining the AMP team in Amsterdam for two days and thousands more watching the </b><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/amp-conf/"><b>livestream</b></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">, marking our biggest event yet. Since last year’s AMP Conf, we’ve seen AMP continue to grow globally as more websites adopt and experiment with the format, with strong results. Europe is home to many AMP websites like </span><a href="https://daily.spiegel.de/"><b>Spiegel Daily</b></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">, which was built with AMP, that demonstrate the strength of the format across devices. And Russian web design studio </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/eski_mobi/"><b>Eski.Mobi</b></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> are using AMP for their ecommerce clients, seeing double digit conversion rate increases across many sites. </span><br/><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">As a result, there are </span><b>now over 31 million domains that have created more than 5 billion AMP pages</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> across  </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/consumers_advocate/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">publishing</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">, </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/merchology/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">ecommerce</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> and </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/wego/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">travel</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. We’re excited and encouraged by the progress, but there is much left to do to continue improving the web user experience. The AMP team is focused on expanding AMP’s horizons, taking its benefits to more websites and platforms across the web. </span></p><h3><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Telling visual stories</span></h3><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Content consumption on the web continues to evolve, especially on mobile. And while some stories are told best through text, the AMP Project wanted to ensure publishers can invest in new ways of storytelling and engaging readers on the open web. </span><b>That’s why </b><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/02/amp-stories-bringing-visual.html"><b>we’ve been working on the AMP story format</b></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. </span></p><p><amp-anim class=" size-full wp-image-1947 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image2.gif?w=660" alt="image2" width="660" height="336" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw"></amp-anim></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">AMP stories use the technical infrastructure of AMP to provide a reliably fast, beautiful experience on the web. And AMP stories live on the web, being hosted on a publisher’s site and can be easily shared or linked. </span><b>Check out some of the latest examples of AMP stories on </b><a href="http://ampproject.org/stories"><b>ampproject.org/stories</b></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. Today AMP stories are available for everyone to try on their websites. As part of the AMP Project, </span><b>the AMP story format is free and open for anyone to use</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">.</span></p><h3><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Empowering commerce</span></h3><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Ecommerce websites have also seen progress with AMP as the format matures to support greater interactivity. Like </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/us_xpress/"><b>US Xpress</b></a><b> which is projecting to save over $1M a year using AMP</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> pages to recruit truck drivers, or </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/event_ticket_center/"><b>Event Tickets Center</b></a><b> which has seen a 20% lift in conversion rates</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> compared to their responsive site. The AMP team is committed to providing e-commerce websites with </span><b>new functionalities like the </b><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/new-in-amp-date-picker-easier-css-development-and-more-amp-by-example-content/"><b>datepicker and payment methods</b></a><b> to make AMP sites even more useful</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. And we’re excited to highlight AliExpress in particular, which just launched their new AMP mobile site, decreasing load time by &gt;40% and increasing conversion rates for new users by &gt;4.3%.</span></p><h3><amp-img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1948 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image3.png?w=437&amp;h=422" alt="image3" width="437" height="422" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image3.png?w=437&amp;h=422 437w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image3.png?w=874&amp;h=844 874w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image3.png?w=150&amp;h=145 150w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image3.png?w=300&amp;h=289 300w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image3.png?w=768&amp;h=740 768w" sizes="(min-width: 437px) 437px, 100vw"></amp-img></h3><h3><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">The AMP ecosystem</span></h3><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">The growth of AMP is also a result of strong support across the web ecosystem. Platforms and services across the globe such as Baidu, Sogou, VK (Russia), 360 Search and Twitter link out to AMP pages. Twitter in particular has seen positive results with their AMP support, seeing </span><b>a 10% reduction in page load abandonment on AMP pages compared to non-AMP</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. Many publishers and businesses have websites that rely on a CMS platform. Sites on platforms such as Drupal, BigCommerce and Squarespace are able to publish AMP pages. And today, Google, together with XWP and Automattic, released the </span><a href="https://github.com/Automattic/amp-wp"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">0.7 version</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> of the WordPress AMP plugin to better support an all-AMP experience in WordPress. We’re committed to ensuring the web ecosystem allows for the creation of AMP pages.</span></p><h3><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">New surfaces for AMP</span></h3><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Last year, we looked at everything AMP was capable of and saw a huge opportunity for AMP to modernize one of the most popular and widely used communication channels: email. Today we announced AMP for Email — a new way to include AMP components in email messages across all platforms. Many people rely on email for information about flights, events, news, purchases and more— </span><a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2017-2021-Executive-Summary.pdf"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">over 270 billion</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> emails are sent each day! With AMP for Email, information in email messages can be dynamic, kept up-to-date and made actionable. We’re really excited about the possibilities — developers and businesses will be able to send more expressive and interactive email messages than ever before.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Companies like Pinterest, Booking.com and Doodle have already built new experiences using AMP for Email, and we’re excited to see what others will do soon. The AMP for Email spec is </span><a href="https://github.com/ampproject"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">available today</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> and Gmail is planning to support it later this year. In the meantime, developers can access a developer preview for Gmail, </span><a href="http://g.co/AMPforEmail"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">here</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">.</span></p><h3><amp-anim class="  wp-image-1946 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/image1.gif?w=598&amp;h=299" alt="image1" width="598" height="299" sizes="(min-width: 598px) 598px, 100vw"></amp-anim></h3><h3><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Community</span></h3><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Ultimately the success of an open source project like AMP is dependent on the contributions and support across the web. I speak for the entire AMP team when I say that we are extremely grateful for all the input, contributions, and support we’ve seen over the past several years. We have over 560 contributors on Github, with the majority (88%!) outside the core AMP team at Google. And as always, we sincerely would love for more of you to get involved and build the project with us.
