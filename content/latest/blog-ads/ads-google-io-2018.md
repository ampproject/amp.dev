Components like </span><a href="https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-bind/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">amp-bind</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> and </span><a href="https://ampbyexample.com/visual_effects/basics_of_scrollbound_effects/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">amp-position-observer</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> provide developers the tools to create their own rich interactivity on their AMP pages, rather than relying on more narrowly defined components. Along with these low-level frameworks, AMP has been focused on making it easier to create complex, immersive interactions. </span><a href="https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-fx-collection/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">amp-fx-collection</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> bundles some of the behaviors like parallax scrolling trivial to implement; </span><a href="https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-date-picker/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">amp-date-picker</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">, now available as an experiment, offloads the complexity of a fully-featured date picker to a straightforward component; and with </span><a href="https://ampbyexample.com/components/amp-lightbox-gallery/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">amp-lightbox-gallery</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">, also available as an experiment, any developer can easily provide users with a seamless, immersive, media gallery.<br/></span><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"><br/></span><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">In fact, AMP’s evolution has made it a viable solution to build entire websites. Major e-commerce companies like AliExpress have seen sizable business wins by launching a single all-AMP-driven mobile site. </span><b>In particular AliExpress increased their conversion rate for non-search traffic by 31%.</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> Combining AMP with PWA is also a powerful usage pattern, with sites like </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/bmw/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">BMW.com building AMP pages within a PWA</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> shell to load custom-built, all-AMP content for a seamless and fast user experience. BMW.com has seen 30% higher click through rates to national websites and 26% more mobile users overall. Finally, news content sites like </span><b>Tencent who recently launched their news site </b><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/learn/showcases/"><b>built entirely with AMP</b></a><b> saw a 2x increase in time on site </b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">and a 3.5x increase in page views per session.</span></p><p><b>WordPress<br/></b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Support for AMP in the CMS ecosystem is critical to ensuring it’s easy to author content on the web.

Since then, the AMP team has been working with Chrome and the web community to allow AMP URLs to point to a publisher’s domain when served from the cache. By utilizing the signed exchanges component of emerging Web Packaging technology, web content can be bundled and allow other parties to distribute it, while keeping the integrity guarantees of HTTPS. AMP project collaborators Food Network and Pinterest have built demos to showcase the capabilities of Web Packaging; one is shown below. To make this process easier, they used a new set of tools available at </span><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amppackager"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">https://github.com/ampproject/amppackager</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">.

Content consumption on mobile is changing, with engaging, fullscreen storytelling formats becoming increasingly popular. While the web has all the capabilities to create content like this, the technical investment can be challenging. So to help meet this need, <strong>we are working with publishers to build the AMP stories format, a rich set of web components for storytelling on mobile.</strong> And while AMP stories are designed for mobile, they also work great on desktop. We’re continuing to prepare the format for a full release, but to learn more and try the developer preview now, visit </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/stories/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">ampproject.org/stories</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">.</span></p><div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><amp-youtube data-videoid="6zcYgQhH5TE" layout="responsive" width="660" height="371"></amp-youtube></div><p class="amp-wp-inline-a6ec8840dd8107f0c4f9cbd7d00cece0"><i><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Examples of AMP stories from various publishers</span></i></p><p class="amp-wp-inline-2b4d2be2e69fb2a80f3ea04ab4df1142"><b>AMP for Email<br/></b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Additionally, we’re thinking about new ways to allow the broader web ecosystem to benefit from AMP. The AMP format is ideal for embedding content in other web-based experiences because it is performant, secure, and functional. While not immediately obvious, email is a great use case to enable actionable and interactive capabilities while maintaining the controls needed in an email client. To bring this experience to life, we’ve been collaborating with companies like Pinterest and Zillow. The AMP for email demos they have built showcase a new type of functionality that AMP facilitates inside the inbox. </span></p><p class="amp-wp-inline-a6ec8840dd8107f0c4f9cbd7d00cece0"><i><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"><amp-anim class=" size-full wp-image-2041 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/image1.gif?w=660" alt="image1" width="660" height="330" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw"></amp-anim>Pinterest using AMP to enable interactivity inside an email</span></i></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Most importantly, we want to thank the more than 500 contributors and additional collaborators we’ve worked with for helping to create a more user-friendly web. There are 6 billion AMP pages on the web, and they only exist through the work of the community that has come together to build the project. And we’re excited about the new capabilities and use-cases for AMP, which are brought to life by the folks working directly with the core AMP team. <strong>To learn about the latest in the AMP community, </strong></span><strong><a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/ampnewsletter/">subscribe to our new newsletter</a></strong><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">, and to see all of the AMP talks at Google I/O 2018, check out </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPBsjgKKG2HqsKBhWA4uQw"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">the AMP YouTube channel</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">.</span></p><p><em><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Posted by Matt Ludwig, Marketing Lead for AMP at Google </span></em></p>	</div>
