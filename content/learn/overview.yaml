  content: AMP is an open-source library that provides a straightforward way to create web pages that are compelling, smooth, and load near instantaneously for users. AMP pages are just web pages that you can link to and are controlled by you.<p>AMP builds on your existing skill sets and frameworks to create web pages. AMP is supported by many <a href="/support/faqs/supported-platforms.html">different platforms</a>, and it's compatible across <a href="/support/faqs/supported-browsers.html">browsers</a>.</p><p>AMP's ecosystem includes 25 million domains, 100+ technology providers, and leading platforms, that span the areas of publishing, advertising, e-commerce,  local and small businesses, and more!</p>

  components:
    - title: AMP HTML
      subtitle: |
        **AMP HTML** is HTML with some restrictions for reliable performance.
      description: |
        AMP HTML is basically HTML extended with custom AMP properties.
        The simplest AMP HTML file looks like this:
      example: /content/includes/html-example.md
      description2: |
        Though most tags in an AMP HTML page are regular HTML tags,
        some HTML tags are replaced with AMP-specific tags (see also
        [HTML Tags in the AMP spec](/docs/fundamentals/spec.html)).
        These custom elements, called AMP HTML components,
        make common patterns easy to implement in a performant way.
        <p>For example, the [`amp-img`](/docs/reference/components/amp-img.html) tag
        provides full `srcset` support even in browsers that don’t support it yet.
        Learn how to [create your first AMP HTML page](/docs/getting_started/create.html).
        <p>AMP pages are discovered by search engines and other platforms
        through the `<link rel="">` HTML tag.  You can choose to have a non-AMP
        version and an AMP version of your page, or just an AMP version. Learn
        more in [Make Your Page Discoverable](/docs/fundamentals/discovery.html).
    - title: AMP JS
      subtitle: |
          The **AMP JS** library ensures the fast rendering of AMP HTML pages.
      description: |
        The [AMP JS library](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/src) implements
        all of [AMP's best performance practices](/learn/about-how/),
        manages resource loading and gives you the custom tags mentioned above,
        all to ensure a fast rendering of your page.
        <p>Among the biggest optimizations is the fact that it makes everything that comes from external resources asynchronous, so nothing in the page can block anything from rendering.
        <p>Other performance techniques include the sandboxing of all iframes, the pre-calculation of the layout of every element on page before resources are loaded and the disabling of slow CSS selectors.
        <p>To learn more about not just the [optimizations](/learn/about-how/) but the limitations, [read the AMP HTML specification](/docs/fundamentals/spec.html).
    - title: AMP Cache
      subtitle: |
          The **Google AMP Cache** can be used to serve cached AMP HTML pages.
      description: |
          The [Google AMP Cache](https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/) is a proxy-based content delivery network
          for delivering all valid AMP documents.
          It fetches AMP HTML pages, caches them, and improves page performance automatically.
          When using the Google AMP Cache, the document, all JS files and all images load
          from the same origin that is using
          [HTTP 2.0](https://http2.github.io/) for maximum efficiency.
          <p>The cache also comes with a built-in
          [validation system](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/validator)
          which confirms that the page is guaranteed to work,
          and that it doesn't depend on external resources.
          The validation system runs a series of assertions
          confirming the page’s markup meets the AMP HTML specification.
          <p>Another version of the validator comes bundled with every AMP page. This version can log validation errors directly to the browser’s console when the page is rendered,
          allowing you to see how complex changes in your code
          might impact performance and user experience.
          <p>Learn more about [testing your AMP HTML pages](/docs/fundamentals/validate.html).
