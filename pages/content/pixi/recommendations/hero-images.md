Let AMP Caches and Optimizers optimize your hero images by adding the [`data-hero` attribute](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/amp-optimizer-guide/explainer/?format=websites#hero-image-optimization) to images in your first viewport. This can improve image loading times by up to 50%.
