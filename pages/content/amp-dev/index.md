<h3>Many brands profit from AMP’s qualities and capabilities</h3>
<p>Since AMP’s inception over 4 billion AMP pages have been created and an independent study found that AMP leads to a 10% increase in website traffic with a 2x increase in time spent on page. For e-commerce websites using AMP, the study also found a 20% increase in sales conversions compared to non-AMP pages. Advertisers are also seeing better performance on AMP pages, with publishers seeing higher viewability and click-through rates compared to non-AMP pages.</p>
