    text: 'The Post publishes over 1,000 articles in AMP every day, and they’re already seeing concrete benefits. “We have seen load times average 400 milliseconds, an 88% improvement over our traditional mobile website. This has made readers more likely to tap on Washington Post stories because they know our articles will load consistently fast.”<br><br>AMP has been great for retention as well. Traditionally 51% of mobile search users return to The Washington Post within 7 days. For users who read stories published in AMP, this number jumps to 63%.'

    quote: Getting started with AMP was easy because it is built on existing web technologies. And since AMP is not a template based system, we were able to host our content, style it as we see fit, and easily integrate our existing advertising, analytics and other business tools
