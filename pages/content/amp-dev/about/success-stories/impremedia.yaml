    headline: Challenge
    text: 'As a digital publisher with over 28 million monthly global users, optimal site quality is a priority for ImpreMedia. While there were few indications of poor site performance, ImpreMedia knew that they needed to continuously optimize in order to sustain the long-term growth of their platforms.<br><br>In 2018, they began looking for a way to grow their online audience and speed up the mobile experience. ImpreMedia’s primary concern was achieving these UX improvements, while still increasing ad revenue. Having dealt with unsuccessful experimentation of other mobile publishing formats, they had some initial hesitation -- but AMP quickly proved to be the solution they were looking for.'

    headline: Solution
    text: 'In April 2018, ImpreMedia kicked off a gradual approach to AMP, first implementing on a single article on <a href="https://laopinion.com/">laopinion.com</a> and eventually the whole site. They credit the ease of implementation to the extensive documentation and examples on amp.dev.<br><br>To test these changes on staging servers, they used the <a href="https://validator.ampproject.org/">AMP project validator</a>; then used the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/amp">Google AMP Validator</a> to test the live updates. Along the way, monetization of each AMP section was a priority. Laopinion.com reached an AMP RPM higher than the RPM of mobile web. After this initial success with laopinion.com, ImpreMedia implemented AMP for all canonical content sections on all of their websites. By January 2019, AMP was fully launched for three of ImpreMedia’s main sites.'
