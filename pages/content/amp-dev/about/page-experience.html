      <h1>Page experience success with AMP</h1>
      <p>Page experience is a set of signals from Google that measure how users perceive their experience interacting with a web page beyond its pure information value. Google's internal studies and industry research found that users prefer sites with a great page experience. A high page experience score helps your content surface to users in places like the top stories feature, and encourages them to return to your site.</p>

      <h2>Get started with AMP</h2>
      <p>AMP is open-source! This means it’s already supported on many CMS’, such as WordPress, and integrated with framework favorites like Eleventy and Next.js.<br>If you’re working with a custom solution, use AMP optimizers on your build-system, server, or hosting environment.</p>
