The AMP Project would not be possible without help from all members of the community
whether you are a developer, content creator or provider of services relevant to AMP.
There are many ways for you to contribute.

### Reporting issues with AMP
If you have feedback or are experiencing technical issues with AMP, please file it using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues).  If you're having issues with [amp.dev](https://amp.dev), please use the [docs issue tracker](https://github.com/ampproject/docs/issues) instead.

### Providing technical contributions to AMP

The AMP Project strongly encourages technical contributions!

We hope you'll become an ongoing participant in our open source community, but we also welcome one-off contributions for the issues you're particularly passionate about.

#### Helping with code

To get started with contributing code to the AMP Project read through [the CONTRIBUTING file](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/docs/contributing.md), which includes details of the process by which a feature or bug fix goes from concept to submission and how you can participate in technical designs and discussions.  If you're new to open source we have some [tips for getting started](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/docs/contributing.md#contributing-code).

### Providing content contributions to AMP 
Content on [amp.dev](https://amp.dev) is how developers learn to build successful web experiences with AMP. We appreciate your interest in updating, creating, and requesting useful documentation! 

#### Helping with documentation

 Documentation? We've got all sorts -- examples for uses of AMP, tutorials to get developers started, and guides to explore AMP's features. 

[amp.dev](https://amp.dev) is where most people get familiar with AMP.  You can contribute to documentation in the [ampproject docs GitHub project](https://github.com/ampproject/docs).  (You can even make [the page you are reading](https://github.com/ampproject/amp.dev/blob/future/pages/content/amp-dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/contribute/index.md) better!

Get started by reading our [content contribution guide](contribute-documentation/index.md?format=websites).

#### Helping with translations
AMP strives to make the world wide web a better experience for everyone. To enable everyone in the world to use AMP, we need translation contributors for guides, tutorials, blogs and all things written for AMP. To get involved with localizing AMP documentation for your community, check out the [AMP Translation Initiative](translations/?format=websites).
