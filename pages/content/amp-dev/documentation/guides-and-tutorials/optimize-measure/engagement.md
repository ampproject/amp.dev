Here are some quick tips to improve user engagement with AMP.

### Help readers identify you with consistent branding and rich content across AMP and non-AMP pages

- **Reflect your brand in AMP pages.** Use the same header and design scheme (e.g. colors, spacing, type styles) as in your non-AMP pages to ensure your pages are recognizable and appear legitimate.

- **Feature your most engaging content** when converting your pages. Include key page elements like images, videos, embeds, structured data, comments and social media. Learn how to [include 3rd-party content](../../../documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/media_iframes_3p/third_party_components.md).

- **Keep AMP pages current.** Dynamically update live blogs with [`amp-live-list`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-live-list.md).

### Optimize for user engagement and retention

- **Provide interactive experiences** on your AMP pages. Use components like [`amp-carousel`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-carousel.md) to create rich image carousels and [`amp-iframe`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-iframe.md) to
  incorporate interactive elements that AMP does not natively support.

- **Create personalized user journeys.** Offer a login button, and if your content
  lives behind a paywall, implement your rules and offers using [`amp-access`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-access.md).

- **Extend onward journeys.** Link to related or suggested articles and other
  relevant sections of your site.

- **Personalize content** by including recommendations through [`amp-list`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-list.md).

- **Implement a menu** with [`amp-sidebar`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-sidebar.md) to encourage users to browse the rest
  of your site.

- **Help readers share your content** with [`amp-social-share`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-social-share.md) and your
  own share buttons.

- **Cultivate new interactions** such as lead generation, newsletter signup, and
  comment support with [`amp-form`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-form.md).

- **Aim for ad types that offer a good reader experience.** Explore AMP ad
  formats such as [`amp-sticky-ad`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-sticky-ad.md) and [`amp-fx-flying-carpet`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-fx-flying-carpet.md). Follow ads
  monetization [best practices](../../../documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/monetization/index.md).

- **Drive app downloads.** Include an app install link in a banner with
  [`amp-app-banner`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-app-banner.md).

- **Ensure a fast transition** to your non-AMP Progressive Web App (PWA) site for
  readers. Use [`amp-install-serviceworker`](../../../documentation/components/reference/amp-install-serviceworker.md) to populate your cache.

### Participate in the open-source AMP Project to help shape its development

- **Watch the AMP roadmap** for updates and features at [roadmap](../../../community/roadmap.html).

- **Get involved.** Contribute source code, file bugs, or offer feedback
  on [GitHub](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/main/docs/contributing.md). Share your input about AMP at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/amp-html).

- **Learn** how to use AMP components with [Examples](../../../documentation/examples/index.html).
